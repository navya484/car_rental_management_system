        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>By renting with us, you agree to our policies on age and licensing, rental period, payment, insurance, fuel, and liability for traffic violations. Additional fees may apply for late returns and cancellations.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Renters must be at least 21 years old (or meet the specific age requirement for your location) to rent a vehicle. Some vehicles may have additional age restrictions.</li>
            <li>A valid driverâ€™s license, held for at least 12 months, is required. Additional ID may be required at certain locations, such as a passport for international renters.</li>
            <li>The minimum rental period is 24 hours. Early returns will not result in any rental refund.</li>
            <li>Full payment is required at the time of booking. A security deposit may be held on your credit card and refunded after the vehicle is returned in good condition.</li>
            <li>Basic insurance coverage is included in the rental. Optional additional coverage can be purchased at an extra cost to reduce liability in case of an accident or damage.</li>
            <li>Vehicles should be returned with the same fuel level as at the start of the rental. Refueling fees will apply if the fuel level is lower.</li>
            <li>The renter is responsible for any traffic tickets, parking fines, or other violations incurred during the rental period.</li>
            <li>Rentals may include mileage limits. Additional charges will apply if the vehicle exceeds the allowed mileage.</li>
            <li>Late returns will incur additional hourly or daily charges. If you expect a delay, please notify us in advance.</li>
            <li>Cancellations made within 24 hours of the rental may incur a fee. Changes to the booking, such as extending the rental period, are subject to availability and additional fees.</li>
            <li>Vehicles cannot be used for commercial purposes, racing, or off-road driving. Violation of this condition may result in fines or the termination of the rental agreement.</li>
        </ul>
